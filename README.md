Caution: don't laugh at my codes (or u can!) as I am a newbee to data science and unfortunately I am not from a coding background but 
 	 I have always been I interested in super cool Technologies, Coding, AI etc. thats why I do it for Fun.   ;)


------------------this much work is done until now.--------------------------------------

>> Extensive data cleaning is done by me like i filled the missing age values by taking the average of male ,females,child 
   seperately and then filled them.


>> some feautre engineering is also done. I created 2 new columns as 'Is_married' and 'IsChild', by finding 
   the title 'Mr.' , 'Mrs.', 'Miss.', 'Master.' and created the column accordingly . 


>> different models are build using various Machine learning techniques such as logistic regression, Decision trees, Randomforest, and Neural networks.
